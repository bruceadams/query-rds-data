# Version 4.0.0

- Upgrade to AWS SDK release (1.x) versions.
- Switch error handling to anyhow.
- Switch logging to tracing.

I'm treating the logging change, moving log level from a command line
option to an environment variable, as a breaking change.

# Version 3.0.2

And, um, correct the broken download links in the README.

# Version 3.0.1

Add install, download & build into README.

# Version 3.0.0

Use cargo-dist to build and package release binaries.
